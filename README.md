# ROCK-PAPER-SCISSOR
so I built a simple Rock Paper Scissors game online. Basically, you pick your move, the computer picks theirs, and boom, winner takes all. It's just a fun little web thing, nothing fancy, all front-end stuff. Thought it'd be a chill way to waste a few minutes, you know? Like, when you're waiting for something, or just bored. hopefully, it works.
